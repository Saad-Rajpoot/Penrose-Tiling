## Introduction

Penrose tiling is a non-periodic tiling generated by an aperiodic set of prototiles. It creates fascinating, never-repeating patterns that are both mathematically intriguing and visually captivating. This Flutter project recreates the Penrose tiling experience, allowing users to generate and manipulate these intricate patterns through an intuitive mobile interface.

## Features

- **Interactive UI:** Adjust parameters and watch the Penrose tiling pattern transform in real-time.
- **Customizable Designs:** Change the size, shapes, and arrangement of tiles to generate unique patterns.
- **Responsive Layout:** The app adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent and engaging experience.
- **Smooth Animations:** Enjoy fluid transitions as you tweak the parameters and see the tiling evolve instantly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Penrose-Tiling.git
    cd Penrose-Tiling
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Run the app:**

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Usage

After running the app, you will see a Penrose tiling pattern displayed on the screen. Use the slider at the bottom to adjust the parameters and explore different designs.

### Adjusting Parameters

- **Tile Size:** Controls the size of the Penrose tiles.
- **Tile Shape:** Controls the shape and arrangement of the tiles.

## Code Overview

### Main Widgets

- **PenroseTilingDemo:** This is the main widget containing the UI elements, including the slider and the CustomPaint widget.
- **PenroseTilingPainter:** A custom painter class responsible for drawing the Penrose tiling pattern on the canvas.

Here is an example of the `PenroseTilingPainter` class:

```dart
class PenroseTilingPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final double tileSize;
  final double tileShape;

  PenroseTilingPainter({required this.tileSize, required this.tileShape});

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final paint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.blue
      ..strokeWidth = 2.0
      ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke;

    // Implement the logic to draw Penrose tiling
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(PenroseTilingPainter oldDelegate) {
    return oldDelegate.tileSize != tileSize || oldDelegate.tileShape != tileShape;
  }
}
```

### Customization

You can modify the `PenroseTilingPainter` class to change how the Penrose tiling is drawn. Adjust the parameters like `tileSize` and `tileShape` to see different patterns. Here's how you might do it:

```dart
class PenroseTilingPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final double tileSize;
  final double tileShape;

  PenroseTilingPainter({required this.tileSize, required this.tileShape});

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Drawing logic
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(PenroseTilingPainter oldDelegate) {
    return oldDelegate.tileSize != tileSize || oldDelegate.tileShape != tileShape;
  }
}
```
